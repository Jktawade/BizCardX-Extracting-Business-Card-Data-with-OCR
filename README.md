# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

## What is EasyOCR?

   EasyOCR, as the name suggests, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.It is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. In my project I am using easyOCR to extract text from business cards.

## Overview
BizCardX is a Streamlit web application which extracts data from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Users can upload an image of a business card and the application uses the easyOCR library to extract relevant information from the card. The extracted information is then displayed in a user-friendly format and can be stored in a MySQL database for future reference.
The application allows users to view, modify, or delete the extracted data. It also has a user interface for uploading business card images and a table interface for displaying the extracted data.
